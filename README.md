# MCB_FrontEndTest

The web client is built in Java and the UI in JavaFX. It makes use of the GSON Maven resources, which allows JSON Strings to be converted to Java Objects.

Posts and comments form the API can be searched and filtered in the 'Search' tab of the UI. The results displayed will either be 
'posts' or 'comments', based on which section is being used by the user. 

Searched 'posts' can be exported to CSV files, which can be opened with other software, such as Excel.

A new post can be posted from the 'Post' tab.

To run the code, download the repository and extract the contents. Open the extracted folder in a Java IDE and run the Main.java class.
